    <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
    .
</p>
<p>
    1.1 Hoplist Services.
</p>
<p>
    Welcome to Hoplist! We are a social and activity platform dedicated to
    bringing the world together through unique and dedicated experiences and
    activities. Through our platform, mobile apps and services, we enable
    people all over the world to create activities, discover activities, share
    and join activities created.
</p>
<p>
    Our Privacy Policy explains how Hoplist collects, uses, and discloses
    information about you. The terms “Hoplist,” “we,” “us,” and “our” include
    Hoplist, Inc. and our affiliates. We use the terms “Guest,” “Host”, “You,”
    “Consumer”, “Creator”, and “Your” to mean any person using our Platform or
    attending related activities, including any organization or person using
    the Platform on an organization’s behalf or using our services to consume
    information about activities or experiences created. This Privacy Policy
    applies to the processing of information about members and other
    individuals that we collect when you use our “Platform,” which means any
    website, application, or services we offer, or when you communicate with
    us. For information about choices that we offer under this policy, please
    see “Your Choices” below. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the
    information that you may provide to third parties, such as members, guests,
    hosts, and others with whom you may share information about yourself.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Collection of Information</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    There are five general categories of information we collect.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1.1 Information You Give to Us.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We collect information that you provide directly to us. For example, we
    collect information that you provide when you create an account, create an
    activity, fill out a form, or communicate with us. The types of information
    that we may collect include your name, username, password, email address,
    phone number, payment method data, photos, and any other information that
    you choose to provide. Information about your gender and date of birth is
    optional. To help create and maintain a trusted environment, we may collect
    identity verification information (such as images of your government issued
    ID, passport, national ID card, or driving license, as permitted by
    applicable laws) or other authentication/verification information.
</p>
<p>
    To use certain features of the Hoplist Platform (such as joining an
    activity or creating an activity), we may require you to provide certain
    financial information (like your bank account or credit card / debit card
    information) in order to facilitate the processing of payments (via third
    party application).
</p>
<p>
    When you communicate with Hoplist or use the Hoplist platform to
    communicate with other members, we collect information about your
    communication and any information you choose to provide.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1.2 Information You Choose to Give to Us.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You may choose to provide us with additional personal information in order
    to obtain a better user experience when using the Hoplist Platform. This
    additional information will be processed based on our legitimate interest
    or when applicable, your consent.
</p>
<p>
    You may choose to provide additional information as part of your Hoplist
    profile (such as gender, phone number, personal description (bio), date of
    birth. Some of this information as indicated in your Account settings is
    part of your public profile page, and will be publicly visible to others.
</p>
<p>
    You may choose to import your address book contacts or enter your contacts’
    information manually to access certain features, like sharing or inviting
    them to use Hoplist.
</p>
<p>
    You may otherwise choose to provide us information when you fill in a form,
    update or add information to your Hoplist Account, respond to surveys, post
    to community forums, participate in promotions, communicate with our
    customer care team, share your experience with us or use other features of
    the Hoplist Platform.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        1.3 Information that is Necessary for the use of the Payment Services.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The payment method or payment gateway needs to collect certain financial
    information necessary to process payment on the Hoplist Platform.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Note :</strong>
    Hoplist is not associated with any of the trademarks which might appear
    visible in the Online Payment method lists or payment gateways. Hoplist does not itself support these payment methods, or
    claim to be in partnership with them. Also, services provided by Hoplist
    Platform are not authorised, approved, endorsed or sponsored by any of the
    payment methods we use or their respective trademark owners. Payment method
    listings are visible on the Hoplist Platform for informative purposes only.
    Trademarks which might appear visible on the Hoplist Platform, belong to
    the respective trademark owners alone.
</p>
<p>
    If you are a host, creator, guest, Hoplist may require identity
    verification information (such as images of your government issued ID,
    passport, national ID card, Bank Verification Number) or other
    authentication information, your date of birth, your address, email
    address, phone number and other information in order to verify your
    identity, provide payment services to you, and to comply with applicable
    law.
</p>
<p>
    If you are a guest and register for a paid activity, you will provide
    financial information (e.g., your credit card number and expiration date,
    billing address, etc.) some of which may constitute Personal Data. In
    addition, the Creator can request any information from the Guest in
    connection with registration for a Creator's event listed on the Hoplist
    Platform. Hoplist does not control a Creator's registration process nor the
    Personal Data that they collect. When you Join an Activity for, or
    otherwise provide information to Hoplist in conjunction with a Creator
    event or activity, whether that information is yours or a third party’s, in
    connection with a purchase, registration, or transfer, that Creator will
    receive and may use the information you provide.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        1.4 Information we Automatically Collect from Your Use of the Hoplist
        Platform and Payment Services.
    </strong>
</p>

    When you use Hoplist Platform, we automatically collect information about
    you, including
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Log Data and Device Information</strong>
    : We automatically collect log data and device information when you access
    and use the Hoplist Platform, even if you have not created a Hoplist
    Account or logged in. That information includes, among other things -
    details about how you’ve used the Hoplist Platform (including if you
    clicked on links to third party applications), IP address, access dates and
    times, hardware and software information, device information, device event
    information, unique identifiers, crash data, cookie data, and the pages
    you’ve viewed or engaged with before or after using the Hoplist Platform.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Geo-location Information</strong>
    : When you use certain features of the Hoplist Platform, we may collect
    information about your precise or approximate location as determined
    through data such as your IP address or mobile devices’s GPS to offer you
    an improved user experience. Most mobile devices allow you to control or
    disable the use of location services for applications in the device’s
    settings menu. Hoplist may also collect this information even when you are
    not using the app if this connection is enabled through your settings or
    device permissions.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Usage Information</strong>
    : We collect information about your interactions with the Hoplist Platform
    such as the pages or content you view, your searches for Activities,

    use our mobile app or engage with our online ads or email communications.
    We may collect certain information by automated means using technologies
    such as cookies, web beacons, pixels, browser analysis tools, server logs
    and mobile identifiers. In many cases the information we collect using
    cookies and other tools is only used in a non-identifiable manner without
    reference to personal information. For example, we may use information we
    collect to better understand website traffic patterns and optimize our
    website experience. In some cases, we associate the information we collect
    using cookies and other technology with your personal information. Our
    business partners may also use these tracking technologies on the Hoplist
    Platform or engage others to track your behavior on our behalf.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Pixels and SDKs</strong>
    : Third parties, including Facebook and Google, may use cookies, web
    beacons, and other storage technologies to collect or receive information
    from our websites and elsewhere on the internet and use the information to

    other apps and use that information to provide measurement services and
    targeted ads.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Do Not Track Signals</strong>
    : While you may disable the usage of cookies through your browser settings,
    the Hoplist Platform currently does not respond to a “Do Not Track” signal
    in the HTTP header from your browser or mobile application due to lack of
    standardization regarding how that signal should be interpreted.

    transactions through any of the payment gateway we may use. Information may
    include payment instrument used, date and time, payment amount, payment
    instrument expiration date and billing postcode, BVN information, your

    necessary for the adequate performance of the contract between you and the
    payment gateway and Hoplist Platform to allow the provision of the Payment
    Services.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1.5 Information we Collect from Third Parties</strong>
</p>

    Hoplist Platform may collect information, including personal information,
    that others provide about you when they use the Hoplist Platform and the
    Payment services, or obtain information from other sources and combine that

    Services. We do not control, supervise or respond for how the third parties
    providing your information process your Personal Information, and any
    information request regarding the disclosure of your Personal Information
    to us should be directed to such third parties.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Social Media Services</strong>
    : If you link, connect, or log into your account through a third-party
    social media service (eg Facebook, Google), we will have access to some of
    your third-party account information from that service, such as your name
    and other information in that account, and used for purposes such as
    improving your Hoplist experiences and recommendations. We may also have

    to share a link.

    by applicable laws, Hoplist may obtain reports from public records of
    criminal convictions. For members outside of the Federal Republic of
    Nigeria, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and with your consent
    where required, Hoplist may obtain the local version of police, background
    or registered sex offender checks. We may use your information, including
    your full name and date of birth, to obtain such reports.

<p>
    <strong>Invitations</strong>
    : If another member sends you an invitation through the Hoplist Platform,
    we may receive certain Personal Information, such as your name, email
    address, or phone number. If you are an invited guest, we will

    information only to send these invitations and evaluate their success. You
    may unsubscribe from future invitations using the instructions in those
messages. You may also contact us at    <a href="mailto:privacy@hoplist.co">privacy@hoplist.co</a> to request that
    we remove this information from our database.

    : To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may receive additional
    information about you, such as demographic data or information to help
    detect fraud and safety issues, from third party service providers and/or
    partners, and combine it with information we have about you. For example,
    we may receive fraud warnings from service providers like identity
    verification services for our fraud prevention and risk assessment efforts.

    <strong></strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>How we Use Your Personal Data</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We collect and use the Personal Data we collect in a manner that is
    consistent with this Privacy Policy, and applicable privacy laws. We may
    use the Personal Data as follows:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2.1 Specific Reason.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If you provide Personal Data for a certain purpose, we may use the Personal
    Data in connection with the purpose for which it was provided. For
    instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you
    provide to answer your question or resolve your problem and will respond to
    the email address from which the contact came.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2.2 Access and Use.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to or use of the
    Services or any functionality thereof, we will use your Personal Data to
    provide you with access to or use of the Services or functionality and to
    analyze your use of such Services or functionality. For instance, if you
    supply Personal Data relating to your identity or qualifications to use
    certain portions of the Services, we will use that information to make a
    decision as to granting you access to use of such Services and to assess
    your ongoing qualification to use such Services. We may use the Personal
    Data you provide to improve and develop the Hoplist Platform such as to
    enable you communicate with other Guests and Creators; to Operate, protect,
    improve and optimize the Hoplist Platform and experience such as by
    performing analytics and conducting research and provide customer service;
    to send you service or support messages, updates, security alerts, and
    account notifications; If you provide us with your contacts’ information,
    we may process this information (i) to facilitate your invitations, (ii)
    for fraud detection and prevention, and (iii) for any purpose you authorize
    at the time of collection; to operate , protect, improve and optimize the
    Hoplist Platform and experience (such as making activities suggestions,
    ranking search results).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2.3 Create and Maintain a Trusted and Safer Environment.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We may use Your Personal Information to create and maintain a trusted and
    safer environment such as to detect and prevent fraud, spam, abuse,
    security incidents, and other harmful activity; conduct security
    investigations and risk assessments; verify or authenticate information or
    identifications provided by you (such as to verify your address or compare
    your identification photo to another photo you provide); conduct checks
    against databases and other information sources, including background or
    police checks, to the extent permitted by applicable laws with your consent
    where required; comply with our legal obligations; resolve any disputes
    with any of our Creators or Guests and enforce our agreement with third
    parties; enforce our Terms of Service and other policies and; in connection
    with the activities above, we may conduct profiling based on your
    interactions with the Hoplist Platform, your profile information and other
    content you submit to the Hoplist Platform, and information obtained from
    third parties. In limited cases, automated processes may restrict or
    suspend access to the Hoplist Platform, our community or third parties. We
    process this personal information for these purposes given our legitimate
    interest in protecting the Hoplist Platform to measure the adequate
    performance of our contract with you, and to comply with applicable laws.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2.4 Internal Business Purposes.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We may use your Personal Data for internal business purposes, including
    without limitation, to help us improve the content and functionality of the
    Services, to better understand our Users, to improve the Services, to
    protect against, identify or address wrongdoing, to enforce our Terms of
    Service, to manage your account and provide you with customer service, and
    to generally manage the Services and our business.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2.5 Hoplist Marketing</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We may use your Personal Data for our marketing and advertising purposes,
    including (without limitation) by email, SMS marketing, display media, and
    targeting other devices (such as tablets, mobile devices and televisions).
    We do this in order to inform you about services or activities we believe
    might be of interest to you, develop promotional or marketing materials and
    display Hoplist or activity-related content and advertising on or off the
    Services that we believe might be of interest to you. We may also do this
    on behalf of a Creator, for example where your prior interactions with a
    Creator suggest you may be interested in a particular type of activity.
</p>
<p>
    You may see advertisements for our Services (or our Creator’s events) on
    third party websites, including on social media platforms. Where you see an
    advertisement on a third party website or social media platform, this may
    be because we engaged the third party or social media platform to show this
    advertisement to our Users, or to others who have similar attributes to our
    Users. In some cases, this involves sharing your email address or other
    contact details with the third party or social media platform so that they
    can identify you as one of our Users, or identify other individuals with
    similar attributes to you in order to show them advertisements for our
    Services (or for our Creator’s events). If you no longer want your Personal
    Data to be used for these purposes please contact us at privacy@hoplist.co.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2.6 Creator Emails.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We allow Creators to use our email tools to contact Guests for their
    current and past activities, so you may receive emails from our system that
    originate with such Creators and that we send on their behalf. If you
    registered for an event on the Services, your email address is available to
    that Creator. However, Creators may also import the email addresses they
    have from external sources and send communications through the Services to
    those email addresses and we will deliver those communications to those
    email addresses on the Creator’s behalf. The Creator and not Hoplist is
    responsible for sending these emails.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2.7 Use of Internet Based Data.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We sometimes make inferences about the type of events or activities you may
    be interested in. We may use these inferences to help target advertising or
    customize recommendations to you, including on behalf of Creators. We may
    do this on an aggregated or generalized basis. For instance, we may
    determine that our users who attend many “Nature &amp; Outdoor” activities
    also often attend or show interest in “Sport &amp; Wellness” activities or
    content. We may direct (or assist in directing) content or recommendations
    related to both “Nature &amp; Outdoor” and “Sport &amp; Wellness” to those
    Users.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2.8 Other Purposes.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If we intend to use any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent
    with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use
    prior to or at the time the Personal Data is collected or we will obtain
    your consent subsequent to such collection but prior to such use.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2.9 Aggregated Personal Data.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In an ongoing effort to understand and serve our Users better, we often
    conduct research on our customer demographics, interests and behavior based
    on Personal Data and other information that we have collected. This
    research is typically conducted on an aggregate basis only that does not
    identify you. Once Personal Data is in an aggregated form, for purposes of
    this Privacy Policy, it becomes Non-Personal Data.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>How we Share and Transfer Your Personal Data</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We are not in the business of selling your Personal Data. We consider this
    information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. Therefore, we
    will not sell your Personal Data to third parties, including third party
    advertisers. There are certain circumstances in which we may disclose,
    transfer or share your Personal Data with certain third parties without
    further notice to you, as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        3.1 Advertising and Social Media; Sharing with Your Consent.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Where you have provided consent, we share your information, including
    personal information, as described at the time of consent, such as when you
    authorize a third party application or website to access your Hoplist
    Account or when you participate in promotional activities conducted by
    Hoplist or third parties.
</p>
<p>
    Where permissible according to applicable law we may use certain limited
    personal information about you, such as your email address, to hash it and
    to share it with social media platforms, such as Facebook or Google, to
    generate leads, drive traffic to our websites or otherwise promote our
    products and services or the Hoplist Platform. These processing activities
    are based on our legitimate interest in undertaking marketing activities to
    offer you products or services that may be of your interest.
</p>
<p>
    The social media platforms with which we may share your personal
    information are not controlled or supervised by Hoplist. Therefore, any
    questions regarding how your social media platform service provider
    processes your personal information should be directed to such a provider.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3.2 Sharing between Guests and Creators.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    When you register for an activity, sign up for communications, enter a
    contest, or otherwise input your Personal Data (such as through a web form)
    to communicate with a creator or participate in a Creator’s activities,
    that Creator will receive that information. For instance, if you input your
    name and email address into a web form for a Creator’s offer or activity,
    the Creator will receive that information. The Creator may then send you
    marketing or other communications, which may be subject to its own,
    separate privacy policy. Likewise, if you provide your mobile phone number,
    you may receive information messages related to the service, activity or
    information in which you’ve expressed interest.
</p>
<p>
    When you purchase tickets to, Join an Activity or donate to an event,
    transfer an activity ticket or registration to another person, enter a
    contest, or otherwise input your Personal Data (such as through a web
    form), or otherwise communicate with a Creator, or participate in or
    express interest in a Creator or Creator’s activity, that Creator will
    receive the information you provide, including your Personal Data, and
    where a ticket or registration is transferred, the Personal Data of the
    transferee as well. Other third parties that are involved in or on whose
    behalf an activity is promoted, may receive that Personal Data as well.
</p>
<p>
    For example, as to fundraising pages, we may provide your Personal Data
    both to the Creator charity of the fundraising page and the Creator of the
    event to which the fundraising page is linked. In some instances, a Creator
    may appoint a third party, which may or may not be affiliated with the
    Creator, to create an event or fundraising page on its behalf (we call
    these third parties ("Third Party Creators"). For example, and without
    limitation, a concert venue (the Creator, in this case) may allow third
    party promoters or production companies (the Third Party Creators) to
    create events that will be hosted at the Creator's venue using its Hoplist
    account. In that case, we may provide your Personal Data to the Third Party
    Creators on behalf of the Creators. The same is true for contests and
    sweepstakes: we may provide your Personal Data to both the Creator
    promoting the contest or sweepstakes, and any legal sponsor of the contest
    or sweepstakes (such as a brand sponsor).
</p>
<p>
    We are not responsible for the actions of these Creators, or their Third
    Party Organizers (or other downstream recipients of your Personal Data),
    with respect to your Personal Data. It is important that you review the
    applicable policies of the Creators, and if applicable and available, their
    appointed Third Party Creators, of an activity (and the related fundraising
    page, if applicable) before providing Personal Data or other information in
    connection with that activity or related fundraising page.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, if you are a member of a Creator's organization within Hoplist,
    your Personal Data will be available to the Creator and shared with those
    Third Party Creators granted permission by the Creator to view all members
    of the Creator's organization.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        3.3 Facebook, Social Media and Other Third Party Connections.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Connecting Your Hoplist Account to Social Media Services. You can connect
    your Hoplist account to your accounts on third party services like
    Facebook, in which case we may collect, use, disclose, transfer and
    store/retain information relating to your account with such third party
    services in accordance with this Privacy Policy. For example, if you
    connect with Facebook, we store your Facebook id, first name, last name,
    email, location, friends list and profile picture and use them to connect
    with your Facebook account to provide certain functionality on the
    Services, like recommending activities that your Facebook friends are
    interested in and sharing the activities you are interested in, or
    attending, with certain groups of people like your Facebook friends.
</p>
<p>
    “Liking” or “Following” Hoplist on Social Media. In addition, when you
    “like” or “follow” us on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or other social media
    sites (to the extent we provide that capability), we may collect some
    information from you including your name, email address, and any comments
    or content you post relevant to us. We likewise may collect your
    information if you sign up for one of our promotions or submit information
    to us through social media sites.
</p>
<p>
    Facebook Plug-Ins and Links on Our Pages. Hoplist’s own website may contain
    links to Facebook as well, such as through the Facebook “Like” or “Share”
    button or other social plug-ins. When you interact with these features and
    links, your browser will establish a direct link with the Facebook servers,
    and Facebook will receive information about your browser and activity, and
    may link it to your Facebook user account. For more information about how
    Facebook uses data, please see Facebook’s own policies.
</p>
<p>
    Additional Facebook Marketing and Connectivity. In addition, if you are a
    member of Facebook (or another social media platform), and you provide
    Personal Data to a Creator, the Creator may use that Personal Data to send
    you advertising and offers through Facebook (or another social media)
    platform, including when you are on Facebook or another social media
    platform. The Creator may work with us and with third parties to enable
    this data integration and advertising. Facebook and other social media
    platforms may provide a way to opt out of this type of advertising. Please
    review their user settings and support pages to learn more about how they
    help you to manage privacy and marketing choices.
</p>
<p>
    Third party services and integrations. Hoplist may provide you with
    opportunities to contract directly with third parties, and/or to integrate
    with third party services or applications, through our platform. In such
    instances, we will disclose your Personal Data to other entities in order
    to fulfill a request by you, or to provide services you have requested.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3.4 Business Transfers.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In
    the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or
    similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets. We may
    also disclose your Personal Data in the course of due diligence for such an
    event. You acknowledge and agree that any successor to or acquirer of
    Hoplist (or its assets) will continue to have the right to use your
    Personal Data and other information in accordance with the terms of this
    Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3.5 Agents, Consultants and Service Providers.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We may share your Personal Data with our contractors and service providers
    who process Personal Data on behalf of Hoplist to perform certain
    business-related functions. These companies include our marketing agencies,
    online advertising providers, data enhancement and data services providers,
    database service providers, backup and disaster recovery service providers,
    email service providers, payment processing partners, customer support,
    tech support, hosting companies and others. When we engage another company
    to perform such functions, we may provide them with information, including
    Personal Data, in connection with their performance of such functions.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3.6 Legal Requirements.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law in order to
    (for example) respond to a subpoena or request from law enforcement, a
    court or a government agency (including in response to public authorities
    to meet national security or law enforcement requirements), or in the good
    faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) comply with a legal
    obligation, (b) protect or defend our rights, interests or property or that
    of third parties, (c) prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in
    connection with the Services, (d) act in urgent circumstances to protect
    the personal safety of Users of the Services or the public, or (e) protect
    against legal liability.

</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Other Important Information</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We collect and use the Personal Data we collect in a manner that is
    consistent with this Privacy Policy, and applicable privacy laws. We may
    use the Personal Data as follows:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>4.1 Analyzing your Communications.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We may review, scan, or analyze your communications on the Hoplist Platform
    for fraud prevention, risk assessment, regulatory compliance,
    investigation, product development, research, analytics, and customer
    support purposes. For example, as part of our fraud prevention efforts, we
    scan and analyze messages to mask contact information and references to
    other websites. In some cases, we may also scan, review or analyze messages
    to debug, improve and expand product offerings. We use automated methods
    where reasonably possible. However, occasionally we may need to manually
    review some communications such as fraud investigations and customer
    support or to assess and improve the functionality of these automated
    tools. We will not review, scan, or analyze your messaging communications
    to send third party marketing messages to you, and we will not sell reviews
    or analyses of these communications. These Communications are carried out
    based on Hoplist’s legitimate interest in ensuring compliance with
    applicable laws and our Terms, preventing fraud, promoting safety, and
    improving and ensuring the adequate performance of our services.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>4.2 Third-Party Planners and Integrations.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Hoplist Platform may contain links to third party websites or services,
    such as third party integrations, co-branded services, or third
    party-branded services (“Third Party Partners”). Hoplist doesn’t own or
    control these Third Party Partners and when you interact with them, you may
    be providing information directly to the Third Party Partner, Hoplist or
    both. These Third Party Partners will have their own rules about
    collection, use, and disclosure of information. We encourage you to review
    the privacy policies of other websites you visit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Parts of the Hoplist Platform may use third party services such as Google
    Maps/Earth services, including the Google Maps API(s). Use of these
    respective services is subject to their privacy policies.
</p>

    <strong></strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>How We Store Your Personal Data</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We may store Personal Data itself or such information may be stored by
    third parties to whom we have transferred it in accordance with this
    Privacy Policy. We take what we believe to be reasonable steps to protect
    the Personal Data collected via the Services from loss, misuse,
    unauthorized use, access, inadvertent disclosure, alteration and
    destruction. However, no network, server, database or internet or email
    transmission is ever fully secure or error free. Therefore, you should take
    special care in deciding what information you send to us electronically.
    Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data.

            How You Can Access, Update, Correct or Delete Your Personal Data
        </strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You can access or delete your Personal Data stored by us. If you are a
    registered User, you can do this by logging in and visiting the “Settings”
    page to edit some of your Personal Data or delete your Personal Data. In
    certain cases, you can ask us to correct and update any inaccurate Personal
    Data using the contact information privacy@hoplist.co, and we will consider
    your request in accordance with applicable laws.
</p>
<p>
    If a Consumer initiates a data deletion request, Hoplist is authorized to
    delete or anonymize Personal Data of the requesting Consumer from the
    services even if that means removing its availability to the Creator
    through the Services. However, if you are a Consumer, you understand that
    even if Hoplist deletes or anonymizes your Personal Data upon your request
    or pursuant to this Policy, your Personal Data may still be available in
    the Creator’s onw databases if transmitted to the Creator prior to Hoplist
    receiving or taking action on any deletion or anonymization activity.

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>How Long We Retain Your Personal Data</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We may retain your Personal Data as long as you are registered to use the
    Services. You may delete your account by visiting the “Settings” page.
    However, we may retain Personal Data for an additional period as is
    permitted or required under applicable laws. Even if we delete your
    Personal Data it may persist on backup or archival media for an additional
    period of time for legal, tax or regulatory reasons or for legitimate and
    lawful business purposes.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Your Choices</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You have several choices available when it comes to your Personal Data :
</p>
<p>
    <strong>8.1 Account Information.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You may update or correct your account information by editing your account
settings or by sending a request to    <a href="mailto:privacy@hoplist.co">privacy@hoplist.co</a>. You may
    deactivate your account by editing your account settings or by sending an
    email to privacy@hoplist.co.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>8.2 Limit the Amount of Personal Data You Provide.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You can browse the Services without providing any Personal Data (other than
    Automatic Data to the extent it is considered Personal Data under
    applicable laws) or with limiting the Personal Data you provide. If you
    choose not to provide any Personal Data or limit the Personal Data you
    provide, you may not be able to use certain functionality of the Services.
    For instance, in order to Join an Activity as a Guest, your name and email
    address will be required by the Creator.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>8.3 Location Information.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    When you first access the Hoplist Platform, we will collect information
    about your location which we use to show you activities within your
    Location. If you do not want us to collect information about your location,
    then you can prevent this, if using a mobile app, by changing the settings
    on your device. If you chose to do this, you may not be able to user
    certain functionality of the Services.
    <br/>
    Your mobile device settings may also give you the option to choose whether
    to allow us view your location on a continuous basis, when only using the
    app, or never. Allowing us to view your location when you are not using the
    app allows us to provide you with recommendations on a regular basis.
    Please refer to your device’s guide for additional information on how to
    adjust location services.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>8.4 Promotional Communications.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You can control messages that you receive from Hoplist, other members, and
    third parties by selecting the unsubscribe link in the message that you
    receive. If you opt-out, we may still send you non-promotional messages,
    such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations.
</p>
<p>
    If you connect your Facebook account or sign up for other social media
    integrations whose product features include social notifications (i.e
    updates on what your friends are doing on the Services), you will receive
    these social notifications. You can manage these social notifications by
    toggling your social settings to private or disconnecting such integration.
</p>
<p>
    Certain communications from Hoplist are responsive to your requests. For
    instance, if you are a Consumer, we must email you your ticket or
    registration on behalf of the Creator when you purchase such ticket or
    registration. As a further example, if you email our customer support
    department, we will return your email. Notwithstanding any unsubscribe
    election that you have made, you will still receive these transactional or
    responsive emails. You can stop receiving these types of emails only by
sending us a mail at    <a href="mailto:privacy@hoplist.co">privacy@hoplist.co</a>. By electing to
    stop receiving all electronic communications from us through our system,
    you will no longer receive any updates on activities you have created
    (including payout issues) or on activities you have registered to join
    (including emails with your tickets). We do not recommend you do this
    unless you plan to no longer use the Services, are not currently registered
    to join an activity, are not currently creating an activity, and will have
    no need to receive further communications from us through our system.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>8.5 Retention.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    It may take up to forty-eight (48) hours for us to process an unsubscribe
    request. Even after you opt-out of all electronic communications, we will
    retain your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy, however,
    we will no longer use it to contact you. However, Creators who have
    received your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy may
    still use that Personal Data to contact you in accordance with their own
    privacy policies, but they may not use our system to do so.

<p>
    <strong>9.1 Personal Data Provided to Others.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data that you provide to
    another User or Guest through the Services or through any other means,
    including to Creators on activity pages or information posted by you to any
    public areas of the Services.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>9.2 Third Party Links.</strong>

    The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third
    Party Sites. The links from the Services do not imply that we endorse or
    have reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites
    directly for information on their privacy policies.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>9.3 Children’s Data.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of
    eighteen (18). If you are under the age of eighteen (18), please do not
    submit any Personal Data through the Services. We encourage parents and
    legal guardians to monitor their children’s internet usage and to help
    enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide
    Personal Data through the Services without their permission. If you have
    reason to believe that a child under the age of 18 has provided Personal
Data to us through the Services, please send us a mail at    <a href="mailto:privacy@hoplist.co">privacy@hoplist.co</a> and we will
    endeavor to delete that information from our databases.
</p>
<p>
        <strong>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Services and our business may change from time to time. As a result, at
    times it may be necessary for us to make changes to this Privacy Policy. We
    reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to update or modify this Privacy
    Policy at any time (collectively, "Modifications"). Modifications to this
    Privacy Policy will be posted to the Site with a change to the "Updated"

    may, but need not, provide you with additional notice of such
    Modifications, such as via email or with in-Service notifications.
    Modifications will be effective thirty (30) days following the "Updated"
    date or such other date as communicated in any other notice to you.
</p>
<p>
    Please review this policy periodically, and especially before you provide
    any Personal Data. Your continued use of the Services following the
    effectiveness of any Modifications to this Privacy Policy constitutes
    acceptance of those Modifications. If any Modification to this Privacy
    Policy is not acceptable to you, you should cease accessing, browsing and
    otherwise using the Services.
